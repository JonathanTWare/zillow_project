    "\n",
    "In this project we will be using the Telco Data Set. Exploring the data, we will find features that are indepent and dependent on churn(using a stats test), in order to run features through a model that will predict whether a customer will churn. The goal is to beat baseline accuracy using one of the three algorythms: KNNeighbor, RandomForest and Logistic Regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "The chi-square test is a statistical method used to examine the relationship between categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the chi-square test, we aim to determine whether there is a significant relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The test helps us assess if the observed frequencies of the categorical variables differ significantly from what we would expect under the assumption of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the chi-square test in Python, we can use the chi2_contingency function from the scipy.stats module. This function takes the individual clusters as input and returns the chi-square statistic (chi2) and the p-value (p). The chi-square statistic represents the ratio of two variances, while the p-value indicates the probability of obtaining test results as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.\n",

    "In summary, the hypotheses for the independent t-test and chi2 test can be stated as follows:\n",

    "Null Hypothesis (H0): Tenure does not have an association with churn.\n",

    "\n",

    "Null Hypothesis (H0): Total charges is not associated with churn.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): Total charges is associated with churn.\n",
